// One {wire value -> label} row of a codegen-emitted lookup table.
//
// The tables (text_sensor `options:` / `codes:`, event `codes:`) are emitted as
// `static const VitoOption name[] = {...}` via cg.static_const_array(), so they
// live in .rodata and an entity holds only a pointer and a count. Previously
// each row was a separate `add_option()` / `add_code()` statement doing an
// emplace_back on a growing std::vector: a 94-entry fault map reallocated eight
// times (capacity 1 -> 128) and freed each predecessor, interleaved with every
// other allocation ESPHome makes during setup(). Across the complete catalog
// that is 1883 rows and 662 boot allocations -- fatal on an ESP8266 (~40 KiB
// heap), which is why this matters even where the ESP32 absorbs it.
//
// The labels are codegen string literals with static storage, so nothing here
// is owned or freed.

// Common base for any entity that owns an optolink datapoint. The component
// holds a vector<VitoEntityBase*> and dispatches read/write responses and
// errors back to the originating entity via its in-flight pointer. Concrete
// subclasses translate raw Optolink payloads into ESPHome state publishes.
//
// Beyond the read path, the base also carries:
//  * per-entity poll interval (0 = poll on every hub cycle), scheduled by
//    the hub at hub-tick granularity;
//  * a small write buffer + handle_write_response() hook for the encode
//    path (number/select). Entities fill write_buf_/write_len_ and call
//    VitoHomeComponent::request_write(this); the hub owns bus arbitration.
