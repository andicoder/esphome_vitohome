"""ESPHome component for Viessmann Optolink (vendored optolink engine).

P300 (VS2) is the validated protocol; KW (VS1) and GWG are build-time selectable
through the same engine template (protocol_select.h) but untested. Platforms:
sensor, binary_sensor, text_sensor, number, select, switch, text, button,
climate and event. The component decodes and encodes raw Optolink payloads
itself (see ``decode.h``) and uses the in-tree optolink engine (under
``optolink/``) only as the wire/transport layer; the engine's converters are
never exercised (every ``Datapoint`` is built with ``optolink::noconv`` and the
raw-bytes write overload is used).

Why the component decodes rather than using engine converters -- upstream ships
a converter layer, but the vendored copy removed it (THIRD_PARTY.md 13/15)
precisely because:
  * its accessor returned a tagless union with no record of which member was
    written, so reading the wrong member silently returned garbage; and
  * it did all converter math in float32, which loses precision for 4-byte
    counters (uint32 -> float drops bits above 2**24).
``decode.h`` extracts the integer in int64/uint64, scales in double, and only
narrows the *final* value to the float32 ESPHome state requires.

# THE OLD VALUE, 37, WAS FICTION. It was introduced here as "the widely-cited
# safe maximum" with no citation, and nothing supports it:
#   * openv's Protokoll 300 spec documents the length byte as the count of bytes
#     between 0x41 and the checksum, and names NO maximum read length.
#     https://github.com/openv/openv/wiki/Protokoll-300
#   * vcontrold defines no read wider than 9 bytes -- its own documented
#     limitation, not the protocol's.
#     https://github.com/openv/openv/wiki/vcontrold.xml
#   * The one hardware observation ever cited for it -- a 40-byte read at 0x7362
#     erroring on P300 -- was a misdiagnosis. 0x7362 is not a datapoint; it is
#     the block base 0x7360 plus BytePosition 2, an address this generator
#     fabricated. A 2-byte read there fails identically.
# Where 37 probably came from: the response to a 32-byte read opens `41:25:...`,
# and 0x25 = 37, because the P300 length byte counts 5 + payload. Someone read a
# telegram length byte as a data length. Speculative, but it is the only account
# of the number that fits an observed frame.
#

# text_sensors are configured in their own platform blocks, so no single to_code
# ever sees the full set. Each platform therefore *collects* its entity here and
# a FINAL-priority step below emits one static table per kind and hands the hub
# a pointer and a count -- replacing three std::vectors that grew by push_back.
#
# The collection lives in CORE.data (not a module global) because CORE.reset()
# clears it: a module global would leak entities between configs compiled in one
# process, which is exactly what the test suite does.
#
# Single-hub assumption: the store is keyed only by sensor KIND, and a single
# _HUB_VAR records the one hub, so every collected sensor is attributed to it.
# This holds because MULTI_CONF is False -- exactly one `vitohome:` instance is
# permitted, hence one possible parent. If MULTI_CONF were ever set True (e.g.
# two Optolink buses on one node), this would misattribute every sensor to the
# last hub; the fix is to key the store by the resolved parent and emit one
# table per (hub, kind). The platform files still resolve CONF_VITOHOME_ID, so
# the parent handle is available to reintroduce.

    # ``optolink/CMakeLists.txt`` (ESP-IDF native toolchain). Both exist
    # because of the same underlying limitation, not because of anything
    # PlatformIO- or CMake-specific: ESPHome's own component file copier
    # (``loader.py``'s ``ComponentManifest.resources``) only copies files
    # sitting directly in a component's top level dir; it does not descend
    # into the engine's ``protocol/``, ``datapoint/`` and ``interface/``
    # subdirectories under EITHER toolchain. (ESPHome does have a one-level
    # recursive mode -- ``recursive_sources`` -- but it's hardcoded to
    # ESPHome's own ``esphome.core`` package, not available to external
    # components, and wouldn't reach two levels deep here regardless.) So the
    # engine has to be registered as its own separately-built unit no matter
    # which toolchain compiles it; only the registration mechanism differs:
    #
    #   esp32.toolchain: platformio (current default -- see design_notes.md
    #   SS11 for the toolchain default flip on ESPHome's dev channel): a
    #   ``file://`` library handed straight to PlatformIO's library
    #   dependency finder, which compiles the nested sources with their
    #   structure intact.
    #
    #   esp32.toolchain: esp-idf: PlatformIO is not involved at all, so a
    #   PlatformIO library declaration doesn't reach the build -- worse, if
    #   left registered unconditionally it actively breaks the build, because
    #   ESPHome's PlatformIO-library-to-IDF-component converter
    #   (esphome/platformio/library.py::convert_libraries, upstream) treats
    #   any non-empty ``repository`` string as a git remote with no
    #   ``file://`` case, and tries (and fails) to ``git clone`` this local
    #   directory. The ESP-IDF-native equivalent is
    #   ``esp32.add_idf_component(path=...)``, which writes a real ESP-IDF
    #   Component Manager ``path:`` dependency -- standard, documented IDF
    #   functionality, independent of ESPHome -- into the generated
    #   ``idf_component.yml``. See ``optolink/CMakeLists.txt`` for the
    #   ESP-IDF-side source list and its ``INCLUDE_DIRS ".."`` -- that's not
    #   parity with this function's ``-I`` flag below, it's a *replacement*
    #   for it; see the note there for why.
    #
    # NOTE: this ESP-IDF-native branch has been through full, successful
    # native compiles in this project's sandbox -- both esp32.framework.type:
    # esp-idf and : arduino, each ending in "Successfully compiled program."
    # with real firmware.factory.bin/firmware.ota.bin output, on the pinned
    # ESPHome version (2026.7.0) -- not just codegen succeeding. One real bug
    # was caught and fixed in the process: see optolink/CMakeLists.txt's
    # ``INCLUDE_DIRS ".."`` note. Reproducible with
    # ``esphome compile tests/test.esp32-idf-native.yaml``. Still never run
    # against real hardware, but esp32.toolchain: esp-idf is now the DEFAULT
    # (esp32/__init__.py defaults CONF_TOOLCHAIN to Toolchain.ESP_IDF), and the
    # CI ``compile-idf-native`` job exercises this exact path on every push --
    # so it is a live, gated path, not forward-proofing. Re-run that test config
    # after any change here or under optolink/ before relying on it again.
    #
    # The ``-I`` flag puts the component dir on the include path so the
    # component's ``#include "optolink/optolink.h"`` (and the engine's header
    # tree it pulls in) resolves against that same checkout location. This
    # only works under esp32.toolchain: platformio, though -- confirmed by a
    # real native-toolchain compile failing on exactly this include with the
    # flag left unconditional. ESPHome's native-toolchain generator
    # (``build_gen/espidf.py::get_project_cmakelists``, pinned version
    # 2026.7.0) filters ``CORE.build_flags`` down to flags starting with
    # ``-D``/``-W`` before propagating them project-wide; a plain ``-I`` flag
    # is silently dropped, and "main"'s own generated
    # ``idf_component_register()`` hardcodes ``INCLUDE_DIRS "." "esphome"``
    # with no extension point for a third-party component to add to. Under
    # the native toolchain, ``optolink/CMakeLists.txt`` exposing its own
    # parent dir via ``INCLUDE_DIRS ".."`` is what makes the same include
    # resolve instead -- "main" implicitly REQUIRES optolink via the ``path:``
    # dependency above, and ESP-IDF auto-propagates a required component's
    # public INCLUDE_DIRS to the requiring component. So the flag below is
    # platformio-only in practice even though it's added unconditionally;
    # it's simply inert (unused) under the native toolchain rather than
    # harmful, so there's no need to gate it the way the library
