// Device-clock synchronization, expressed as a VitoEntityBase.
//
// WHY THIS IS AN ENTITY AND NOT A LANE OF ITS OWN
// -----------------------------------------------
// VitoEntityBase is deliberately NOT an ESPHome entity -- it inherits from
// nothing, and the concrete types (VitoSensor, ...) multiply-inherit their Home
// Assistant surface separately. So "a participant in the hub's datapoint lanes"
// and "a thing the user sees in Home Assistant" are already independent ideas
// here. VitoClock is the first: a pure lane participant with no HA presence, no
// platform, and no YAML of its own (it is configured by the hub's time_id /
// time_sync options).
//
// The clock chain maps onto the base class exactly:
//
//   read device clock  -> request_priority_read() -> handle_response()
//   compare drift      -> handle_response()
//   write device clock -> set_write_payload_() + request_write()
//   verify             -> wants_read_back() -> handle_response() again
//
// and the payload fits with zero growth: VitoEntityBase::write_buf_ is 8 bytes
// and the device clock datapoint (0x088E) is exactly 8 bytes of BCD.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACED
// ------------------
// Clock sync used to ride the raw scan-console lane behind a RawPurpose tag.
// That coupled two unrelated tenants in one queue and produced two failure
// modes that do not exist here:
//   * a sweep filling the raw lane could starve a mid-chain clock write;
//   * raw_queue_size: 0 silently disabled time sync (hence a validator rule).
// The read/write lanes are reserve()d to entities_.size() and the
// read_queued_/write_queued_ flags admit an entity at most once, so they
// provably cannot fill. The raw lane is now purely the scan console and
// defaults to 0.
//
// PRIORITY
// --------
// The old raw lane was dispatched AHEAD of the poll lane. An ordinary polled
// entity is not: it queues behind every pending poll, which at a full catalog
// (~700 entities at ~4-5 ops/s) is a ~150 s wait. Harmless for drift itself
// (drift is measured against the live time source at response time, so a late
// read is not a wrong read) but a visible regression for sync_on_boot. So the
// clock is excluded from the poll rotation (wants_polling() == false) and
// pushes to the HEAD of the read lane from its own schedule, preserving the
// original ordering. Writes already preempt reads, so the write step needs
// nothing special.
